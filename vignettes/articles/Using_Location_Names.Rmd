## Introduction

The `rcityviews` package now allows users to generate city views by providing arbitrary location names (e.g., "Hellebecq, Belgium") in addition to predefined cities. This integration leverages the `tidygeocoder` package to convert location names into geographic coordinates seamlessly.

## Examples

### 1. Generating a City View by Arbitrary Location Name

```{r}
#library(rcityviews)

# Generate city view for Hellebecq, Belgium using OpenStreetMap's Nominatim
cityview(name = "Virton, Belgium", method = "osm")
```
